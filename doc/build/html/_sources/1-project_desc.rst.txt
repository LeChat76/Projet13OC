Project Description
===================


**Orange County Lettings** is a start-up in the property rental sector. The start-up is currently expanding in the United States. So the company has decided to take on some new recruits, and you're one of them. As a developer, you're expected to play an important role in improving the company's site, both in terms of code and deployment.

My tasks:
---------
- the code was created in monolitic, I have to rewrite it in modular mode
- optimization of the code:
  - adding personnal page for 404 and 500 html error, correct pluralization, etc...
- add docstrings in all needed part of the code
- set up of a CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)
- errors report via Sentry
- creation of the documentation (the one you are reading, yes)
